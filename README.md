## Some reflections (ahaha)

It is now the year 2022 and the last time I've touched this code was 2011.

Getting the algorhythm for the Deflektor laser right is still somewhat of my nemesis and I've already tried a couple of times.

Reading the MirrorMagic source code unfortunately isn't of much help as the hard bits (how to deal with reflections on the 2x2 block variations) are not very straight forward to understand.

I have a version of this working (somewhat to a similar point) in Pico-8 (Lua) with scaled down graphics as well and that's something I would want to publish at some point, I think. That version from 2015, haha.

What I've done now (in 2022) is to bring this back to life with 2022 versions of the tools I was using back then.

Interestingly, in 2011 the stack I've used here was something I was very fond of and I have a lot of experiments on GitHub or somehwere in an archive that use Sinatra, Coffeescript etc.
